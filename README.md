# stk-bot

## Abstract

`stk-bot` is an automated trading bot project designed to identify and execute equity stock trades with the goal of achieving a 1% daily profit on the invested capital. The bot leverages Machine Learning models trained on historical market data (initially Nifty 50) combined with technical indicators (RSI, MACD, ADX, Bollinger Bands) and momentum analysis to predict potential short-term price movements.

Furthermore, the system aims to provide users with a daily market overview, including relevant news analysis (potentially using generative AI like Gemini) and insights into specific equities before the market opens. Integration with a trading platform API (like Zerodha Kite) is planned for trade execution.

**Disclaimer:** Trading financial markets involves significant risk. This project is for educational and experimental purposes only. Past performance is not indicative of future results. There is no guarantee of achieving the target profit or avoiding losses. Use at your own risk and discretion.

## Core Features

* **ML-Based Stock Prediction:** Utilizes ML models trained on historical data to identify stocks with a higher probability of short-term gains.
* **Technical Indicator Analysis:** Incorporates indicators like EMA, RSI, MACD, ADX, and Bollinger Bands.
* **Momentum Screening:** Identifies stocks exhibiting strong price and volume momentum.
* **Daily Market & News Analysis:** Provides a pre-market briefing on market sentiment and stock-specific news.
* **Automated Trading Goal:** Aims to automate buy/sell orders via a broker API (e.g., Kite) to capture ~1% profit targets. (Requires API setup and robust risk management).
* **Backtesting Framework:** Includes capabilities to test trading strategies against historical data.
* **Web Dashboard:** A Django-based web interface for monitoring, analysis, and potentially triggering actions.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Django, Django REST Framework
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Pandas
* **Data Visualization:** Plotly
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **API Integration:** Zerodha Kite API (planned), Google Generative AI (for news analysis)
* **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
* **Web Server:** Gunicorn
* **Static Files:** Whitenoise

## Setup and Running with Docker

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Docker ([https://www.docker.com/get-started](https://www.docker.com/get-started))
    * Docker Compose ([https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd stk-bot
    ```

3.  **Create Environment File (`.env`):**
    Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory and add the following environment variables. **Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials and keys.**

    ```dotenv
    # PostgreSQL Settings
    POSTGRES_DB=prediction_db
    POSTGRES_USER=postgres
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yoursecretpostgrespassword # Choose a strong password

    # Django Settings
    SECRET_KEY='your-strong-random-django-secret-key' # Generate a secure key
    DEBUG=True # Set to False in production

    # External API Keys
    GEMINI_API_KEY='your_google_gemini_api_key_here'
    # KITE_API_KEY='your_kite_api_key' # Add when integrating Kite
    # KITE_API_SECRET='your_kite_api_secret' # Add when integrating Kite
    ```

4.  **Build and Run Containers:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    * `--build`: Forces Docker to build the image using the Dockerfile.
    * `-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

5.  **Apply Database Migrations:**
    Once the containers are running, apply the Django database migrations:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
    ```
    You might need to run `makemigrations` first if you add models:
    ```bash
    # docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations mainapp
    # docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

7.  **Stopping the Application:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

## Development Tasks Roadmap

* **Phase 1: Foundation & Data**
    * [ ] Set up Django project structure (`prediction_project`, `mainapp`).
    * [ ] Implement historical data fetching script (e.g., for Nifty 50, selected stocks) using a reliable source (e.g., yfinance, broker API). Store data in PostgreSQL.
    * [ ] Develop data preprocessing steps (cleaning, feature engineering).
    * [ ] Implement calculation of technical indicators (EMA, RSI, MACD, ADX, Bollinger Bands) using libraries like `pandas` or `ta-lib`.

* **Phase 2: ML Model & Prediction**
    * [ ] Train initial ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, LSTM) on historical data to predict price movements or probability of hitting the 1% target.
    * [ ] Develop a prediction pipeline that uses the trained model and current indicators.
    * [ ] Create API endpoints (using DRF) to expose predictions.

* **Phase 3: Analysis & Dashboard**
    * [ ] Integrate Google Generative AI (Gemini) for news fetching and summarization related to market/stocks.
    * [ ] Develop Django views and templates for the dashboard.
    * [ ] Use Plotly to visualize historical data, indicators, and predictions on the dashboard.
    * [ ] Display pre-market analysis and news summaries.

* **Phase 4: Trading Integration & Backtesting**
    * [ ] Integrate Zerodha Kite API (or chosen broker API) for fetching real-time data and placing orders (requires careful handling of credentials and API calls).
    * [ ] Implement the core "1% Bot" logic: Monitor predictions/signals, place buy orders, set target sell orders (or trailing stops). **Implement robust risk management.**
    * [ ] Develop a backtesting script/module to evaluate the strategy's performance on historical data.

* **Phase 5: Refinement & Deployment**
    * [ ] Refine ML models based on backtesting results.
    * [ ] Optimize database queries and application performance.
    * [ ] Configure for production (e.g., `DEBUG=False`, static file handling with Whitenoise, secure secrets management).
    * [ ] Consider deployment options (e.g., VPS, cloud platforms).

**Note on `docker-compose.yml` changes:**
* Used `postgres:14-alpine` for a potentially smaller image.
* Mapped host port `5433` to container `5432` for Postgres to reduce potential conflicts with locally running Postgres. You can change `5433` back to `5432` if you prefer and don't have a conflict.
* Added a simple `healthcheck` to the `db` service.
* Made the `web` service `depends_on` the `db` service being healthy before starting.
* Ensured environment variables in the `web` service correctly reference the `.env` file variables and the `db` service hostname (`POSTGRES_HOST=db`). Changed `POSTGRES_DB` to `POSTGRES_NAME` in the `web` environment to avoid potential clashes if Django expects `POSTGRES_NAME`. *Correction*: Django typically uses `NAME`, `USER`, `PASSWORD`, `HOST`, `PORT` within its `DATABASES` setting. The compose file correctly sets `POSTGRES_HOST=db`. The actual env var names passed to Django depend on how `settings.py` reads them (e.g., using `os.environ.get`). Adjusted `web` environment section for clarity and standard practice.

**`manage.py`** (Standard Django file - Place in project root)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
"""Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks."""
import os
import sys


def main():
    """Run administrative tasks."""
    # Make sure 'prediction_project.settings' matches your project's settings module
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'prediction_project.settings')
    try:
        from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
    except ImportError as exc:
        raise ImportError(
            "Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and "
            "available on your PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did you "
            "forget to activate a virtual environment?"
        ) from exc
    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

---

**`mainapp/apps.py`** (Place inside a directory named `mainapp` within your project root)

```python
from django.apps import AppConfig


class MainappConfig(AppConfig):
    default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
    name = 'mainapp' # Ensure this matches the directory name
```

Remember to create the Django project (`django-admin startproject prediction_project .`) and the app (`python manage.py startapp mainapp`) and configure your `prediction_project/settings.py` (especially the `DATABASES` setting to use the environment variables set in `docker-compose.yml`) and add `'mainapp'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.
